### Chapter 1: Artificial Intelligence Basics
1. **Definition of AI**: The science and engineering of making intelligent machines, particularly computer programs.
2. **What is Intelligence**: The computational ability to achieve goals; involves learning, reasoning, perception, and tool usage.
3. **Rationality in AI**:
   - **Rational Decisions**: Focused on maximizing predefined goals using utility-based outcomes.
   - Rationality is about the **decision quality**, not the reasoning process.
4. **AI Approaches**:
   - **Cognitive Science-Based**: Simulate human thinking.
   - **Turing Test-Based**: Achieve human-like performance in tasks.
   - **Laws of Thought-Based**: Use logical inference for problem-solving.
   - **Rational Agent-Based**: Act rationally to maximize goals, even if reasoning is imperfect.

### Chapter 2: AI Agents and Environments
1. **Agent Definition**: Perceives environment via sensors and acts via actuators.
   - **Types**:
     - Human agents: Eyes (sensors), hands (actuators).
     - Robotic agents: Cameras (sensors), motors (actuators).
     - Software agents: Inputs like keystrokes (sensors), outputs like screen display (actuators).
2. **Agent Function**: Maps percept sequences to actions using an agent program.
   - Example: Vacuum-cleaner agent cleans when dirt is detected.
3. **Rational Agents**: Choose actions to maximize success based on:
   - Performance measures, prior knowledge, available actions, and percept history.
   - Rationality focuses on maximizing expected outcomes.
4. **Task Environments**: Described using PEAS (Performance, Environment, Actuators, Sensors).
5. **Environment Types**:
   - Fully vs. Partially Observable.
   - Deterministic vs. Stochastic.
   - Episodic vs. Sequential.
   - Static vs. Dynamic.
   - Discrete vs. Continuous.
   - Single-Agent vs. Multi-Agent.
6. **Agent Architectures**:
   - Simple Reflex Agents: Based on current percept.
   - Model-Based Reflex Agents: Use internal state to track unseen parts.
   - Goal-Based Agents: Plan actions to achieve goals.
   - Utility-Based Agents: Optimize satisfaction using utility functions.
   - Learning Agents: Learn and improve over time using feedback.
